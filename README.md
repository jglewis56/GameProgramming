This folder includes one of the games I worked on building in my intro to game progamming class.
We spent the semester building a zelda game focusing on link. Throughout the class we learned man things
such as Gamer User Interface, coolision detection, adding realistic falling and jumping, using physics
and most importantly, Object-Oriented-Programming.
